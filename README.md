# ORE Protoype (Python)

## Order Revealing Encryption Implementation - as presented by Chenette et al.

This implementation is merely a prototype. As I was studying "Practical Order-Revealing Encryption with Limited Leakage", I decided to implement it in order to help me understand the core mechanics behind an Order-Revealing scheme.

Use at your own risk. It probablty has security flaws that derive from my (possible) misunderstanding of the ORE scheme.
# Even if it is correctly implemented, this scheme has been proved insecure.
